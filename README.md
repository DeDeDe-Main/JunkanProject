# Ser Junkan

- Adds the marketable scrap-boi himself from Enter the Gungeon as a legendary.
- Item displays on Paladin, Enforcer, and Starstorm characters!
- This is my first mod.  The code is somewhat simple, and likely god awful to read.  Please go easy. x3

# Known Issues
- Item model is offset slightly higher than intended resulting in a strange view in the logbook.  Will fix eventually.

# Credits
- The wonderful fellows on the RoR2Modding discord for help with my blatant code illiteracy.
